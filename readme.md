## Purpose
This tutorial demonstrates how to easily establish the architectural stack for doing data science and machine learning projects on AWS, then deploy the machine learning model for real-time prediction. This tutorial, specifically, covers using Sagemaker to train, evaluat, and deploy deep learning models developed in MXNet. Older versions of this tutorial covers training and evaluating in Deep Learning AMI, then deploying in both Lambda and Batch.


## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of cloud computing basics
- Basic experience with Python
- Basic knowledge of Data Scient methodologies, specifically [CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining)

## Recommended Sequence
1. Start with [sagemaker/part0_instructions.md](sagemaker/part0_instructions.md)

## Recommended Sequence - Pre-Sagemaker
1. CRISP-DM Parts 3-5, found in folder 'crispdm345-training'
2. CRISP-DM 6 on AWS Lambda, found in folder 'crispdm6-pred-lambda'
3. CRISP-DM 6 on AWS Batch, found in folder 'crispdm6-pred-batch'
